        <h2>Cleaning</h2>
        <h3>What type of cleaning do you do?</h3>
        <p>We are a tech-enabled company that is revolutionizing the way our daily car cleaning is done. We do waterless cleaning for the exteriors of the car and use vacuum cleaners for the interiors.</p>

        <h3>What is waterless cleaning?</h3>
        <p>Waterless car cleaning is an eco-friendly and efficient car wash that uses little or no water.</p>
        <p>A waterless car wash uses high lubricity sprays to polish and wash the car’s bodywork. The spray’s high lubricity chemicals encapsulate dirt and dust particles. This process is similar to how water removes dirt, but the chemical combination of a waterless car wash product is more efficient.</p>
        <p>You have to simply spray the surface of the car and then wipe it off. This process removes any light dirt or stains from the car’s surface.</p>
        <p>A microfiber towel is used because of high absorbency and softness, which helps to scoop up these dirt particles.</p>

        <h3>What are the advantages of using waterless cleaning?</h3>
